# travisci-lilypond-test

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/karlding/travisci-lilypond-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/karlding/travisci-lilypond-test)

This is just a sample for testing Travis CI with LilyPond.

This sets up Travis CI so that new changes to `master` are automatically built
and uploaded as a GitHub release when a tag is generated.
